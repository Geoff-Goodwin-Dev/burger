# Burger! - Node Express Handlebars Full Stack Application

* **Created:** Saturday, May 12th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the fourteenth week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are building a true full stack application with Express.js, Node.js, Handlebars, and MySQL.  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Though you can do your own local install, it is also deployed on heroku for ease of use: https://burger-app-gg.herokuapp.com/
